Password Generator

## Description

 Coming up with a new strong and secure password can be difficult sometimes, I always just want to add an extra zero on the emd (which is not secure)
 As a usuer I wanted an easy way to generate a random secure password that I could use for new passwords. 
 By creating a random password generator it took the predictability out of my passwords, and harder to guess. 

## Usage

For the site to work properly you must choose the amount of characters you want in your password and then answer the following prompts.
